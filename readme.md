### Question 4:
1. The small example on which we tested our code :
    v1 =(201,37) and v2=(1648,297)
    and it has to give in output :
    v1=(1,32) and v2=(40,1)
2. We have a function that check if the output of LLL algorithm is really reduced.
3. The determinant of the reduced matrix is equal to the determinant of the input matrix in absolute value.

### Question 6:

There is algorithm that allows us to reduce a matrix of integral coefficients to another matrix of integral coefficients.
For more detail about this method look in [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/852.pdf)

### How to run

To launch the program, you can use 'make run' (and 'make build' to only compile).
